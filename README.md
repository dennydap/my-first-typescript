# My First TypeScript

This repository is an example of using TypeScript. This example is my first attempt using TypeScript for the first time. I learned about how to use variables, inheritance, and mixins. If you're on Linux, the way to get TypeScript working on your device is by running this command in Terminal:

````sh
# Install using Node Package Manager
sudo npm install -g typescript
````

After you installed the tools you needed, create a new file with .ts extension. Edit your files in .ts and when you're done, run this command in terminal:

````sh
# Do it!
tsc <your file name>.ts
````

And you're good to go. The .js file will be compiled based on your .ts file. You can include the compiled script in <body> tag.
